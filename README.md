# rpdb - remote debugger based on pdb

rpdb is a wrapper around pdb that re-routes stdin and stdout to a socket
handler. By default it opens the debugger on port 4444:

```python
import rpdb; rpdb.set_trace()
```

But you can change that by simply instantiating Rpdb manually:

```python
import rpdb
debugger = rpdb.Rpdb(port=12345)
debugger.set_trace()
```

It is known to work on Jython 2.5 to 2.7, Python 2.5 to 3.1. It was written
originally for Jython since this is pretty much the only way to debug it when
running it on Tomcat.

Upon reaching `set_trace()`, your script will "hang" and the only way to get it
to continue is to access rpdb using telnet, netcat, etc..:

```shell
nc 127.0.0.1 4444
```

## Installation in CPython (standard Python)

```shell
pip install rpdb
```

For a quick, ad hoc alternative, you can copy the entire rpdb subdirectory
(the directory directly containing the __init__.py file) to somewhere on your
$PYTHONPATH.

## Installation in a Tomcat webapp

Just copy the rpdb directory (the one with the __init__.py file) in your
WEB-INF/lib/Lib folder along with the standard Jython library (required).

## Trigger rpdb with signal

`set_trace()` can be triggered at any time by using the TRAP signal handler.
This allows you to debug a running process independently of a specific failure
or breakpoint:

```python
import rpdb
rpdb.handle_trap()

# As with set_trace, you can optionally specify addr and port
rpdb.handle_trap("0.0.0.0", 54321)
```

Calling `handle_trap` will overwrite the existing handler for SIGTRAP if one has
already been defined in your application.

## Known bugs

- The socket is not always closed properly so you will need to ^C in netcat
  and Esc+q in telnet to exit after a continue or quit.
- There is a bug in Jython 2.5/pdb that causes rpdb to stop on ghost
  breakpoints after you continue ('c'), this is fixed in 2.7b1.
